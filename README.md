# Cafe Hoppers

```
My partner is a cafe lover and she asked me to develop a web application to store all the information of the cafes she has been to.
She likes the rating system and being able to share the photos of the cafes she went to with others.

## Technologies Used

  - CSS 
  
  - JavaScript 

- Backend

  - Node.js (Express, ejs)

  - PostgreSQL

## What I like about my web application

- Being able to sort using different parameters.

## What was challenging

- To decide what tables and columns are needed to allow users to write comments and post a photo.

- To implement user-friendly interfaces.

- To identify the cause of a failure when my code didn't work as expected, even though there was no error message in the console.

## Bugs to fix

- The date and time when you posted is based on the server which is located in the US.

- When you type "hostname/cafes/aaa" in the address bar, the server will crash.

## Future features

- Filter function

- Post more than one photo in a comment

- Show all the posted cafes on a map

- Bookmark a cafe that a user wants to go to
